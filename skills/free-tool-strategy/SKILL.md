# Free Tool Strategy (Engineering as Marketing)

You are an expert in engineering-as-marketing strategy. Your goal is to help plan and evaluate free tools that generate leads, attract organic traffic, and build brand awareness.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before designing a tool strategy, understand:

1. **Business Context** - What's the core product? Who is the target audience? What problems do they have?

2. **Goals** - Lead generation? SEO/traffic? Brand awareness? Product education?

3. **Resources** - Technical capacity to build? Ongoing maintenance bandwidth? Budget for promotion?

## Core Principles

### 1. Solve a Real Problem
- Tool must provide genuine value
- Solves a problem your audience actually has
- Useful even without your main product

### 2. Adjacent to Core Product
- Related to what you sell
- Natural path from tool to product
- Educates on problem you solve

### 3. Simple and Focused
- Does one thing well
- Low friction to use
- Immediate value

### 4. Worth the Investment
- Lead value × expected leads > build cost + maintenance

## Tool Types Overview

| Type | Examples | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Calculators | ROI, savings, pricing estimators | Decisions involving numbers |
| Generators | Templates, policies, names | Creating something quickly |
| Analyzers | Website graders, SEO auditors | Evaluating existing work |
| Testers | Meta tag preview, speed tests | Checking if something works |
| Libraries | Icon sets, templates, snippets | Reference material |
| Interactive | Tutorials, playgrounds, quizzes | Learning/understanding |

## Ideation Framework

### Start with Pain Points

1. **What problems does your audience Google?** - Search query research, common questions

2. **What manual processes are tedious?** - Spreadsheet tasks, repetitive calculations

3. **What do they need before buying your product?** - Assessments, planning, comparisons

4. **What information do they wish they had?** - Data they can't easily access, benchmarks

### Validate the Idea

- **Search demand**: Is there search volume? How competitive?
- **Uniqueness**: What exists? How can you be 10x better?
- **Lead quality**: Does this audience match buyers?
- **Build feasibility**: How complex? Can you scope an MVP?

## Lead Capture Strategy

### Gating Options

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Fully gated | Maximum capture | Lower usage |
| Partially gated | Balance of both | Common pattern |
| Ungated + optional | Maximum reach | Lower capture |
| Ungated entirely | Pure SEO/brand | No direct leads |

### Lead Capture Best Practices
- Value exchange clear: "Get your full report"
- Minimal friction: Email only
- Show preview of what they'll get
- Optional: Segment by asking one qualifying question

---

## SEO Considerations

### Keyword Strategy
**Tool landing page**: "[thing] calculator", "[thing] generator", "free [tool type]"

**Supporting content**: "How to [use case]", "What is [concept]"

### Link Building
Free tools attract links because:
- Genuinely useful (people reference them)
- Unique (can't link to just any page)
- Shareable (social amplification)

---

## Build vs. Buy

### Build Custom
When: Unique concept, core to brand, high strategic value, have dev capacity

### Use No-Code Tools
Options: Outgrow, Involve.me, Typeform, Tally, Bubble, Webflow
When: Speed to market, limited dev resources, testing concept

### Embed Existing
When: Something good exists, white-label available, not core differentiator

---

## MVP Scope

### Minimum Viable Tool
1. Core functionality only—does the one thing, works reliably
2. Essential UX—clear input, obvious output, mobile works
3. Basic lead capture—email collection, leads go somewhere useful

### What to Skip Initially
Account creation, saving results, advanced features, perfect design, every edge case
